# Memory Embodied Question Answering

Official implementation of the paper **"Memory-Centric Embodied Question Answering"**.

In this paper, we propose a memory-centric EQA framework named MemoryEQA. 
Unlike planner-centric EQA models where the memory module cannot fully interact with other modules, MemoryEQA flexible feeds memory information into all modules, thereby enhancing efficiency and accuracy in handling complex tasks, such as those involving multiple targets across different regions.
Specifically, we establish a multi-modal hierarchical memory mechanism, which is divided into global memory that stores language-enhanced scene maps, and local memory that retains historical observations and state information. 
When performing EQA tasks, the multi-modal large language model is leveraged to convert memory information into the required input formats for injection into different modules.
To evaluate EQA models' memory capabilities, we constructed the MT-HM3D dataset based on HM3D, comprising 1,587 question-answer pairs involving multiple targets across various regions, which requires agents to maintain memory of exploration-acquired target information.

# Inference on MT-HM3D
```
sh scripts/run_memory_eqa.sh
```

# Inference on Go2
Complete EQA tasks in real scenarios using Untree Go2.

## Unitree Go2
Your first need install [go2_dashboard](https://github.com/bentheperson1/go2_dashboard) on Unitree Go2.
```
cd go2_dashboard
python app.py
```

## Server
```
python server_wrapper/go2_flask.py # launch go2 interface
python server_wrapper/vlm_flask.py # launch qwen2vl server
sh scripts/run_vlm_real.sh
```

# Results
Experiments on multiple methods across MT-HM3D, HM-EQA, and OpenEQA, testing various foundational models. $^\dagger$ denotes that the value was converted based on the metrics provided in the original paper. $\ddagger$ indicates that the performance was obtained through our replication.

On MT-HM3D, MemoryEQA attains a success rate of 54.5\%, outperforming baseline by 18.9\% (Exp.3), highlighting the critical role of hierarchical memory in multi-target tasks. The results demonstrate that MemoryEQA exhibits superior performance in multi-modal reasoning tasks, particularly in complex scene understanding and knowledge integration.
